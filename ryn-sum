Aegis AI is an AI-powered developer tool that embeds SOC 2 compliance directly into the IDE, automatically detecting and fixing compliance violations in application code as developers write it. Unlike existing platforms (Vanta, Drata) that only monitor infrastructure and collect screenshots, Aegis scans your actual codebase for missing audit logs, weak access controls, hardcoded secrets, and other SOC 2 violations. When it detects non-compliant code (like an API endpoint handling sensitive data without proper logging), it uses AI to generate context-aware fixes and creates one-click pull requests with the remediation. Think of it as "GitHub Copilot for compliance" - providing real-time feedback in VS Code while you're coding, rather than discovering issues months later during an audit. This approach could save startups 150-300 hours of manual compliance work by shifting SOC 2 from a painful post-development checklist into an automated part of the development workflow.
