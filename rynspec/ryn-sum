Ryn is an AI-powered desktop application that brings SOC 2 compliance automation directly into your development workflow, automatically detecting and fixing compliance violations in application code as you commit. Unlike existing platforms (Vanta, Drata) that only monitor infrastructure and collect screenshots, Ryn scans your actual codebase for missing audit logs, weak access controls, hardcoded secrets, and other SOC 2 violations through continuous file watching. When it detects non-compliant code (like an API endpoint handling sensitive data without proper logging), it uses AI powered by LangGraph agents and Claude Haiku 4.5 to generate context-aware fixes and applies them directly via git commit. Think of it as "GitHub Copilot for compliance" - providing real-time feedback as you work, rather than discovering issues months later during an audit. This approach could save startups 150-300 hours of manual compliance work by shifting SOC 2 from a painful post-development checklist into an automated part of the development workflow.
